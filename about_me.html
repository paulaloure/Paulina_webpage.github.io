								<p>My name is Paulina and I am a graduate of earth science - geophysics and geology. But since May 2021 I have been working and actively developping in the field of data.</p>
								<p><b>My professional experience </b></p>
								<p>Currently I work as MI analyst at AML Rightsource. I take care of regular reporting as well as adhoc analysis for stakeholders. 
									I use many tools on daily basis, such as Excel, Domo (for data transformations, pipelines and visualization), Power Query, SQL, Python, GitLab.</p>
									
								<p>But my adventure with data started already at the university, where I was working with processing and visualization of seismic data. 
									My first reporting tasks were at Shell, where I was assisting proactively my team lead with regular team statistics and also providing ad-hoc analysis.</p>
								<p>Then I worked at Cognizant as Data Specialist, mainly with geospatial data. I was responsible for reviewing, cleaning and loading the data, which allowed my to develop my SQL skills. </p>
								<p><b>My personal life</b></p>
								<p>Personally, I live in the beautiful city of Krakow wit my husband. 
									Professional development makes a huge part of my life, but when I am not working with data, I try to stay active. You can find me in the Crossfit box, gym next to my home, streching on my balcony or walking through city's old town.
									</p>
								<p>I also enjoy learning foreign languages, which has been my hobby since childhood. I can speak fluently english, portuguese and polish, which is my native language. I feel also comfortable speaking french and try to learn german. </p>
								<p>I am also interested in the environment we live in and its current and past changes.
